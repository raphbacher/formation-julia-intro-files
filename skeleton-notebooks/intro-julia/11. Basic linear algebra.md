First let's define a random matrix

Define a vector of ones

Notice that $A$ has type Array{Int64,2} but $x$ has type Array{Float64,1}. Julia defines the aliases Vector{Type}=Array{Type,1} and Matrix{Type}=Array{Type,2}. 

Many of the basic operations are the same as in other languages
#### Multiplication

#### Transposition
As in other languages `A'` is the conjugate transpose, or adjoint

and we can get the transpose with

#### Transposed multiplication
Julia allows us to write this without *

#### Solving linear systems 
The problem $Ax=b$ for ***square*** $A$ is solved by the \ function.

`A\b` gives us the *least squares solution* if we have an overdetermined linear system (a "tall" matrix)

and the *minimum norm least squares solution* if we have a rank-deficient least squares problem

Julia also gives us the minimum norm solution when we have an underdetermined solution (a "short" matrix)

# The LinearAlgebra library

While much of linear algebra is available in Julia by default (as shown above), there's a standard library named `LinearAlgebra` that brings in many more relevant names and functions. In particular, it provides factorizations and some structured matrix types.  As with all packages, you can bring these additional features into your session with a `using LinearAlgebra`.

### Exercises

#### 10.1 
Take the inner product (or "dot" product) of a vector `v` with itself and assign it to variable `dot_v`.



#### 10.2 
Take the outer product of a vector v with itself and assign it to variable `cross_v`
