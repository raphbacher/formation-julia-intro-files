**Multiple dispatch** is a key feature of Julia, that we will explore in this notebook.

It helps make software fast. It also makes software extensible, programmable, and downright fun to play with. 

It may just herald a breakthrough for parallel computation.

## 1. Roman numerals (for fun)

Let's define a **new struct** that represents a Roman numeral. For coding simplicity, we'll just deal with numbers between 0 and 9. 

**Exercise**: Extend this to larger numbers. (Recall that Roman numbers are a base-10 system!)

We can create an object of this type as follows:

We would like to display it nicely, in Roman numerals:

It'd be nice to be able to add Roman numerals together like normal numbers:

But Julia doesn't know how to do that. Let's teach it by `import`ing the `+` function, which then allows us to _extend_ its definition:

This **adds a new method** to the function `+`:

But 

The simplest thing to do is to explicitly define multiplication of a `Roman` by a number. We can do it as we see fit:

## Functions

For example, the exponential function is defined as

$$\exp(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} x^n.$$

We can think of this just in terms of functions:

$$\exp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} \mathrm{pow}_n,$$

where $\mathrm{pow}_n(x) = x^n$.

(starts to blur the symbolic with the numerical!)

###  "Sin^2 phi is odious to me, even though Laplace made use of it; should  it be feared that sin^2 phi might become ambiguous, which would perhaps  never occur, or at most very rarely when speaking of sin(phi^2), well  then, let us write (sin phi)^2, but not sin^2 phi, which by analogy  should signify sin(sin phi)." -- Gauss
