## How to get a string

Enclose your characters in " " or """ """!

There are a couple functional differences between strings enclosed in single and triple quotes. <br>
One difference is that, in the latter case, you can use quotation marks within your string.

Note that ' ' define a character, but NOT a string!

## String interpolation

We can use the $ sign to insert existing variables into a string and to evaluate expressions within a string. <br>
Below is an example that contains some highly sensitive personal information.

## String concatenation

Below are three ways we can concatenate strings! <br><br>
The first way is to use the `string()` function. <br>
`string()` converts non-string inputs to strings.

We can also use `*` for concatenation!

### Exercises

#### 2.1 
Create a string that says "hi" 1000 times, first with `repeat` and then with the exponentiation operator, which can call `*` under the hood. Assign it the variable `hi` below.

#### 2.2 
Declare two variables

```julia
a = 3
b = 4
```
and use them to create two strings:
```julia
"3 + 4"
"7" 
```
and store the results in `c` and `d` respectively
