# Packages

Julia has over 2000 registered packages, making packages a huge part of the Julia ecosystem.

Even so, the package ecosystem still has some growing to do. Notably, we have first class function calls  to other languages, providing excellent foreign function interfaces. We can easily call into python or R, for example, with `PyCall` or `Rcall`.

This means that you don't have to wait until the Julia ecosystem is fully mature, and that moving to Julia doesn't mean you have to give up your favorite package/library from another language!

For now, let's learn how to use a package.

The first time you use a package on a given Julia installation, you need to use the package manager to explicitly add it:


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Example")
```

</div>

    [32m[1m  Updating[22m[39m registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
    [32m[1m  Updating[22m[39m git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
    [2K[?25h[32m[1m Resolving[22m[39m package versions...

     [90m [7876af07][39m[92m + Example v0.5.1[39m


Every time you use Julia (start a new session at the REPL, or open a notebook for the first time, for example), you load the package with the `using` keyword


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
using Example
```

</div>

    â”Œ Info: Precompiling Example [7876af07-990d-54b4-ab0e-23690620f79a]
    â”” @ Base loading.jl:1189


In the source code of `Example.jl` at
https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl/blob/master/src/Example.jl
we see the following function declared

```
hello(who::String) = "Hello, $who"
```

Having loaded `Example`, we should now be able to call `hello`


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
hello("it's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet.")
```

</div>




    "Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet."



Now let's play with the Colors package


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
Pkg.add("Colors")
```

</div>

    [32m[1m  Updating[22m[39m `~/.julia/environments/v1.0/Manifest.toml`
    [90m [no changes][39m



<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
using Colors
```

</div>

Let's create a palette of 100 different colors


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
palette = distinguishable_colors(100)
```

</div>

and then we can create a randomly checkered matrix using the `rand` command


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
rand(3, 3)
```

</div>




    3Ã—3 Array{Float64,2}:
     0.795049  0.705551  0.986574
     0.699097  0.898558  0.789346
     0.22399   0.127905  0.170703




<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
rand(1:10, 3, 3)
```

</div>




    3Ã—3 Array{Int64,2}:
     7  5  2
     7  8  7
     8  8  4




<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
rand(palette, 3, 3)
```

</div>
