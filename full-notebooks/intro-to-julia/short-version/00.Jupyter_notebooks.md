## Getting started with Jupyter notebooks

### Running a cell
To execute code within a cell, select that cell and either (1) hit `Shift` and `Enter` or (2) hit the run button (the right pointing arrow) above.


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
1 + 1
2 + 2
```

</div>

If you're new to jupyter notebooks, note that only the last line of a cell prints by default when you execute that cell and that you can suppress this output with a semicolon


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
1 + 1
2 + 2;
```

</div>

### How to get docs for Julia functions

To get docs for a function you're not familiar with, precede it with a question mark. (This works in the terminal too!)


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
?println
```

</div>

### How to use shell commands

Type `;` and then you can use shell commands. For example,


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
;ls
```

</div>


<div class="input_area">
	
```julia
;pwd
```

</div>
